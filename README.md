# Array Cardio Day 1

A series of exercises to practice using various array methods in JavaScript, including `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`. This project is part of the JavaScript30 challenge, aiming to enhance problem-solving skills with JavaScript arrays.

## Description

In this project, we work with two arrays:
- An array of inventors, each with details such as birth year, death year, etc.
- An array of people, which consists of names formatted as "Last Name, First Name".

The challenge includes performing operations on these arrays using various JavaScript array methods such as:
- `filter()` to find inventors born in the 1500s.
- `map()` to create an array of full names of inventors.
- `sort()` to sort inventors by birthdate and their age.
- `reduce()` to calculate the total years all inventors lived.

The project helps reinforce the practical use of array methods and functional programming concepts.

## Features

- **Array Filtering**: Filters inventors born in the 1500s.
- **Array Mapping**: Maps an array of full names from inventor objects.
- **Sorting**: Sorts inventors by their birthdate, oldest to youngest, and by their lifespan.
- **Summing Up**: Uses `reduce()` to calculate the total number of years all inventors lived.
- **Handling Data**: Includes a challenge to sort and count the instances of various forms of transportation in a data set.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (though this project doesn't require an HTML file, it can be tested directly through JavaScript).
3. You can also open `script.js` in the browser console to test the array operations.
